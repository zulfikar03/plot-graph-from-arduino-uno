# This Code for Plotting Graphic AC Sensor Using Python from Arduino IDE

This project is from research Pekan Kreativitas Mahasiswa Riset Eksakta (PKM-RE). 
This project is to measure the voltage from graphen with the capacitor model and using high voltage to made the capacitor result the electricity voltage.
Sensor ZMPT101b is used to measure the Alternating Current using arduino uno. Then, connecting arduino ide to python for data acquititon to better visualization in python.
